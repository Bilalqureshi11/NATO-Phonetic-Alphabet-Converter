# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter 🐍

This is a simple Python project that converts any word entered by the user into its NATO phonetic alphabet representation.

## Project Overview
The program reads data from a CSV file containing NATO phonetic codes and maps each letter of the input word to its corresponding phonetic term.

## Files Included
- `main.py` – Python script that runs the program  
- `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv` – CSV file containing NATO phonetic alphabet data

## How It Works
1. The user enters a word.
2. The program converts the word to uppercase.
3. Each letter is matched with its NATO phonetic equivalent.
4. The phonetic words are displayed as a list.
